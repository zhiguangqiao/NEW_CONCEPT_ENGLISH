[00:16.52]A gifted American psychologist has said, 'Worry is a spasm of the emotion,\n一位天才的美国心理学家曾经说过:"烦恼是感情的发作,\n
[00:24.83]the mind catches hold of something and will not let it go.'\n此时脑子纠缠住了某种东西又不肯松手."\n
[00:29.29]It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition.\n在这种情况下,你和头脑争吵让它松手是无济于事的.\n
[00:33.08]The stronger the will, the more futile the task.\n这种意志越是强烈,这种尝试越是徒劳.\n
[00:36.88]One can only gently insinuate something else into its convulsive grasp.\n你只能缓和而巧妙地让另一种东西进入痉挛僵持的头脑中.\n
[00:42.64]And if this something else is rightly chosen,\n如果这些东西选得合适,\n
[00:46.22]if it is really attended by the illum- ination of another field of interest,\n而且的确受到别的领域的情趣的启迪,\n
[00:50.88]gradually,and often quite swiftly,the old undue grip relaxes,\n那么渐渐地,往往也是很顺利地,原先不适当的紧张就会松弛下来,\n
[00:56.22]and the process of recuperation and repair begins.\n恢复和修整的过程就会开始.\n

[01:28.41]they must be sedulous- ly tended,if the vivi- fying fruits are to be at hand when needed.\n还需要勤勉地护理,这样才能在需要的时候可随手摘取充满生机的果实.\n

[01:39.41]one ought to have at least two or three hobbies,and they must all be real.\n至少应有两三种爱好,而且都比较实际.\n
[01:44.99]It is no use starting late in life to say:'I will take an interest in this or that.'\n到了晚年才开始说:"我会对这个或那个发生兴趣",已没有用了.\n
