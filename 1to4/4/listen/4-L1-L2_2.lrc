[00:42.02]if it were not for the protection we get from insect eating animals.\n幸亏人类受到一些食虫动物的保护才不至于此.\n
[00:47.01]We owe a lot to the birds and beasts who eat insects\n我们要十分感谢那些吃昆虫的鸟和兽,\n
[00:52.37]but all of them put together kill only a fraction of the number destroyed by spiders.\n然而把它们所杀死的昆虫全部加在一起也只相当于蜘蛛所消灭的一小部分.\n
